# Introduction
Plant-pollinator networks describe the interaction between different types of pollinator and plants of a certain territory. Their analysis allow us to answer certain questions, for example:

* What is the relationship between climate and pollinators?
* Can motifs relate the behaviour of pollinators of different species?
* Do different regions have the same pollinators?

**Dataset**: these graphs are publicly available at [https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks](https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks)
